# 22OpsPrBot Documentation

## Introduction
22OpsPrBot is an automated GitHub bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). It was designed to manage and streamline the pull request (PR) deployment process using Docker and GitHub Actions. The bot deploys PRs into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes, provides real-time deployment status updates, and cleans up resources upon PR closure.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys each PR in an isolated Docker container.
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- **Resource Management**: Cleans up Docker containers upon PR closure.
- **Integration with GitHub Actions**: Uses GitHub Actions to handle deployment workflows.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on the server.
- A GitHub repository with appropriate permissions.
- GitHub Actions enabled in the repository.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rotimiAbiola/22OpsPrBot.git
   cd 22OpsPrBot
   ```
   ## Bot Setup

         ```sh
         # Install dependencies
         npm install
         
         # Run the bot
         npm start
         ``` 

2. **Configure Docker**
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your server. Follow the official Docker installation guide if needed.
         ```sh
         # 1. Build container
         docker build -t pr-bot .
         
         # 2. Start container
         docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> pr-bot
         ```

4. **Set Up GitHub Actions**
The repository contains a `.github/workflows` directory with predefined workflows. These workflows automate the deployment process.

5. **GitHub Bot Authentication**
Create a GitHub App for the bot and configure it to interact with your repository. Follow these steps:
  1. Go to your GitHub account settings and create a new GitHub App.
  2. Set the necessary permissions for the app:
     - **Repository**: Read & Write
     - **Actions**: Read & Write
  3. Generate a private key for the app.
  4. Install the app on your repository.

## Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your GitHub repository settings under **Secrets**:
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`: The App ID of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key generated for your GitHub App.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.


## Usage

### Pull Request Deployment
- **Create a Pull Request**: When a new PR is created, the bot triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the PR in a Docker container.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: The bot comments on the PR with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.
- **Subsequent Commits**: Any new commits to the PR branch update the existing Docker container with the latest changes.
- **PR Closure**: Upon PR closure, the bot cleans up the associated Docker container to free up resources.

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows located in `.github/workflows`. Key workflows include:
- **PR Deployment Workflow**: Triggers on PR creation and updates. Builds and deploys the PR in a Docker container.
- **PR Cleanup Workflow**: Triggers on PR closure. Cleans up Docker containers associated with the closed PR.

### Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands within PR comments:
- `@22OpsPrBot deploy`: Manually trigger the deployment process.
- `@22OpsPrBot status`: Check the current deployment status of the PR.
- `@22OpsPrBot cleanup`: Manually trigger the cleanup process for the PR.

## Development and Testing
