# 22OpsPrBot Documentation

## Introduction
22OpsPrBot is an automated GitHub bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). It was designed to manage and streamline the pull request (PR) deployment process using Docker. The bot deploys PRs into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes, provides real-time deployment status updates, and cleans up resources upon PR closure.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys each PR in an isolated Docker container.
- **Multitasking**: handles pull request on multipe branches at the same time
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- **Resource Management**: Cleans up Docker containers upon PR closure.

## Prerequisites
- A linux/ubuntu server
- A GitHub repository with appropriate permissions.

## Setup and Installation

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rotimiAbiola/22OpsPrBot.git
   cd 22OpsPrBot
   ```
### Setting up Environment
This requires installation of all dependencies and setup of all environment variables needed. To simplify the process and ensure compatible versions of dependencies are used, a script environment_setup.sh has been added. 

   ```sh
   # To make the file executable
     chmod +x environment_setup.sh
   # Run the environment_setup.sh
     bash environment_setup.sh
   ```

   ```sh
- cd into the directory
- Npm start
- Access the .env file and copy out the webhook url

      - Pass in the secret

         ```


2. **Configure Docker**
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your server. Follow the official Docker installation guide if needed.
         ```sh
         # 1. Build container
         docker build -t pr-bot .
         
         # 2. Start container
         docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> pr-bot
         ```

4. **Set Up GitHub Actions**
The repository contains a `.github/workflows` directory with predefined workflows. These workflows automate the deployment process.

5. **GitHub Bot Authentication**
Create a GitHub App for the bot and configure it to interact with your repository. Follow these steps:
  1. Go to your GitHub account settings and create a new GitHub App.
  2. Set the necessary permissions for the app:
     - **Repository**: Read & Write
     - **Actions**: Read & Write
  3. Generate a private key for the app.
  4. Install the app on your repository.

## Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your GitHub repository settings under **Secrets**:
- `GITHUB_APP_ID`: The App ID of your GitHub App.
- `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key generated for your GitHub App.
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password.


## Usage

### Pull Request Deployment
- **Create a Pull Request**: When a new PR is created, the bot triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the PR in a Docker container.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: The bot comments on the PR with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.
- **Subsequent Commits**: Any new commits to the PR branch update the existing Docker container with the latest changes.
- **PR Closure**: Upon PR closure, the bot cleans up the associated Docker container to free up resources.

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows located in `.github/workflows`. Key workflows include:
- **PR Deployment Workflow**: Triggers on PR creation and updates. Builds and deploys the PR in a Docker container.
- **PR Cleanup Workflow**: Triggers on PR closure. Cleans up Docker containers associated with the closed PR.

### Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands within PR comments:
- `@22OpsPrBot deploy`: Manually trigger the deployment process.
- `@22OpsPrBot status`: Check the current deployment status of the PR.
- `@22OpsPrBot cleanup`: Manually trigger the cleanup process for the PR.

## Development and Testing

### Local Testing
