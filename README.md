# 22OpsPrBot Documentation

## Introduction
22OpsPrBot is an automated GitHub bot built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot). It was designed to manage and streamline the pull request (PR) deployment process using Docker. The bot deploys PRs into isolated Docker containers for testing and review purposes, provides real-time deployment status updates, and cleans up resources upon PR closure.

## Features
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys each PR in an isolated Docker container.
- **Multitasking**: handles pull request on multipe branches at the same time
- **Real-time Updates**: Comments on PRs with deployment status and links.
- **Resource Management**: Cleans up Docker containers upon PR closure.

## Prerequisites
- A linux/ubuntu server
- A GitHub repository with appropriate permissions.

## Setup and Installation

**Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   # Change directory into the project directory
     cd 22OpsPrBot
   # Clone the Github repository

   ```
### Setting up Environment
This requires installation of all dependencies and a setup of all environment variables needed. To simplify the process and ensure compatible versions of dependencies are used, a script environment_setup.sh has been added.

   # To make the file executable
     chmod +x environment_setup.sh
   # Run the environment_setup.sh
     bash environment_setup.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Pull Request Deployment
- **Create a Pull Request**: When a new PR is created, the bot triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the PR in a Docker container.
- **Real-time Status Updates**: The bot comments on the PR with the deployment status and a link to the deployed environment.
- **Subsequent Commits**: Any new commits to the PR branch update the existing Docker container with the latest changes.
- **PR Closure**: Upon PR closure, the bot cleans up the associated Docker container to free up resources.

- **PR Deployment Workflow**: Triggers on PR creation and updates. Builds and deploys the PR in a Docker container.
- **PR Cleanup Workflow**: Triggers on PR closure. Cleans up Docker containers associated with the closed PR.

### Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands within PR comments:
- `@22OpsPrBot deploy`: Manually trigger the deployment process.
- `@22OpsPrBot status`: Check the current deployment status of the PR.
- `@22OpsPrBot cleanup`: Manually trigger the cleanup process for the PR.
